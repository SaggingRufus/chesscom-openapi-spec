# Chesscom Open-API Specification

This is **not** an official API specification. 

The official chess.com API Documentation can be found [here](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api#pubapi-clients). This [Open-API Specification (OAS)](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification), is my interpretation of this information. I will also add, the Chess.com official documentation of their response objects does not always match the actual response data. 

This is simply my attempt to document this API in a useful way for the community. The publically available documentation is pretty bad, and even inaccurate at times. I have tried to add the missed fields, and properly deprecate everything that was removes since their last post about the API.
